    "The variations of Gauss Newton and Levenberg Marquadt algorithms were found to produce similar kinds of results. So we have used gn_var_cholmod and lm_var_cholmod respectively for these two algorithms. For intel.g2o, we noticed that using GN algo, the graph converged within 10 iterations whereas LM took around 567 iterations. Also, the error for LM was higher than that for GN. We also noticed that using the 2d linear algorithm, we obtain very quick accurate results (in around 3 iterations) for the intel.g2o file, converging with errors similar to the GN algorithm. Such results are obtained because the optimizer is constructed for 2D pose-graph SLAM like the current one. 2d linear algorithm yields good performance on the intel.g2o.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robust Kernel:**\n",
    "When results are obtained by applying the robust kernel option in g2o, the performance seems to be significantly improved as compared to the previously used approaches. A lower error value is obtained for some of the iterations. Among all the variations we tried out, the Huber kernel yielded the best results. Some of the other kernels resulted in low error values but differed from the ground truth. The Huber kernel required 147 iterations to converge ground truth, which is way less as compared to the results obtained without using kernel (459 iterations).\n"
